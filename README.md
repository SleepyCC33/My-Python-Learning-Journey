# My-Python-Learning-Journey
## BackGround: This repositories is used to save the files I wrote during the lesson of Python
  The upload files is the Dorm Electricity Cost Splitter, which was written during the first homework of my lessons. It is written not only because the lessons requirement, but also I was annoyed that I need to use my calculator so hard every time I split the cost.(Beacuse my mate sometimes do not live in the dorm and go back to their home. Meanwhile, we have the same habit of using eletricity.
## How to Use
  First, you need to enter how many people are there in your dorm.(Like in Shenzhen university, We have 4-people and 5-people dorm), such as 4.
  Then your are required to enter how many your dorm cost in this month.
  After that, the application will ask you to input the name and the time you dormmate staying in the dorm. For which it will use to split the cost
  After you complete the filling in, you will get the output of how many cost everyone should pay.
## Install
  You should install Python. It would be better if you install the latest one.
## Contribution and license

## Learning Reflections and Plans
  **Learning Reflection & Future Plans**
  As a long-time GitHub user, I've always downloaded software from GitHub rather than contributing my own. This submission task made me realize the importance—and difficulty—of consistent naming conventions and writing clear README documentation. Writing code comes easily to me, but crafting a README is quite a hassle.
  This project gave me hands-on experience with code storage and taught me about licensing. Moving forward, I plan to use this repository as my learning journal: committing each time I master a new concept. I'll also use branches to manage different projects, optimize my legacy code, and let these commits document my growth journey.
